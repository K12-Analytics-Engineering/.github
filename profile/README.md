## Welcome! 👋🏽

K12 Analytics Engineering is a project maintained by [Marcos Alcozer](https://www.alcozer.dev). The goals are to clearly communicate best practices around analytics engineering in K12 education, help data folks in school districts upskill themselves, and have fun doing it. This project exists as both an open-source version and a managed data platform.

### Managed data platform
The cloud version of the project creates the relationship shown below. Alcozer Consulting takes on the responsibility of infrastructure as well as the extract and load work. This means you, the data person at your district, recieve all your source data in BigQuery along with access to a dbt Cloud project so you can focus on the SQL that transforms the data into reporting tables needed by your reports and dashboards.
